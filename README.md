# Case05PigLatin, an excersize in file-processng 

The task was to create an application that can read any text file file and write pig latin copies of their contents to a seperate files.


Which project to open in this Repo?:
PigLatinParser V2. is the most functional edition of the Application. The original is left in the repository for historical/sentimental purposes.

Notes on reading Documentation.
in the Parsing DSD (design Sequence diagram) only the contents of the "WritePigLatinFile()" box is relevant to the newest version of PigLatinParserV2. 
Start by reading Filewatcher DSD instead.
